# The Rocket
# BlauRingLabsRocket

Assumptions for this solution:

-The number of lines of the rocket does not change during the life of the object
 and it is known at the moment of its creation.

-The number of lines range is {1...100}.

-The design should be easily expandable with different "printers".
